MUMDMC2025 Dataset: A Resource for Accurate Classification of Minerals in Microscopic Thin Section Rock Images

We would like to submit the manuscript titled “MUMDMC2025 Dataset: A Resource for Accurate Classification of Minerals in Microscopic Thin Section Rock Images” by Badr Gamal, Hamdy M. Mousa, Maher Dawoud, and Anas Youssef, to be considered for publication in the Computers & Geosciences Journal.

The manuscript presents the Menoufia University Machine Learning Dataset for Minerals Classification 2025 (MUMDMC2025) which is a comprehensive collection of 14,400 labeled images representing five distinct mineral classes namely: Biotite, Potassium-Feldspar, Hornblende, Plagioclase, and Quartz. This dataset aims to address the limitations of existing datasets and facilitate the development of robust machine-learning models for mineral classification. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed MUMDMC2025 dataset, two widely used machine learning algorithms namely: Decision Trees (DT) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), were employed. The models were trained and tested using the dataset, and their performance was assessed using standard metrics namely: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix analysis. 

We believe that the research topic addressed in this paper exactly matches the scope of the Computers & Geosciences Journal. We also believe that the findings achieved in this paper will help in providing an important resource for accurate machine-based classification of Minerals in Microscopic Thin Section Rock Images.
